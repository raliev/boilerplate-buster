# Automated Discovery of Invariant Document Fragments

This repository presents a novel, scalable seed-and-expand algorithm for the automated discovery of maximal non-gapped sequential patterns within massive textual corpora. 

Established sequential pattern mining frameworks—such as PrefixSpan and BIDE—lack the necessary heuristics to directly isolate the longest most frequent sequences, often resulting in fragmented and redundant outputs. 

Our approach specializes in identifying Maximal Frequent Phrases—the longest contiguous substrings meeting a specific document support threshold—through an iterative greedy expansion model. The algorithm utilizes a multi-phase pipeline involving dictionary-encoded tokenization and aggressive probabilistic pruning via a Counting Bloom Filter to isolate high-potential n-gram seeds. To maintain maximality and prevent redundancy, a global occupancy bitmask is employed to track token-level coverage. By specializing in contiguous substrings and avoiding recursive projections in favor of a priority-based expansion path, the proposed methodology is at least an order of magnitude faster than traditional sequential pattern mining baselines.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd corpus_miner
make
./corpus_miner ../tests/test1 --ngrams 3 --n 3 --algo bloomspan
cat results_max.csv
python3 process_results_csv.py --min_l=3
open visualization.html
```


## Algorithms

The framework supports multiple mining strategies depending on the research objective:

### 1. Primary Algorithm: BloomSpan Miner (Default)

The native "Default" mode is an optimized algorithm designed for extracting contiguous frequent phrases. It uses a **Counting Bloom Filter** to estimate n-gram frequencies with a very small memory footprint, followed by a priority-based expansion using the scoring function $\Psi(P) = |P| \times df(P)$.

* **Usage**: Run without `--algo` or with `--algo bloomspan`.

### 2. BIDE+ Miner
A high-performance C++ implementation of the **BIDE+** (Bidirectional Extension) algorithm. Unlike the default miner, BIDE+ is designed to find **Closed Sequential Patterns**, ensuring that a frequent phrase is only reported if it cannot be extended in either direction without losing support.

* **Usage**: Use the flag `--algo bide`.

### 3. SPMF Integration (Benchmarking)
The framework includes a wrapper for the **SPMF (Sequential Pattern Mining Framework)** library. This is intended solely for **comparative analysis and testing**.

* **Setup**: Download `spmf.jar` from the [official site](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/) and place it in the same directory as the `corpus_miner` binary.
* **Usage**: Use the flag `--spmf` and `--spmf-params "<params>"` and `--spmf-location /path/to/spmf.jar`.

Novelty of the BloomNgramMiner Algorithm
The novelty of the BloomNgramMiner lies in its unique combination of probabilistic data structures, out-of-core processing, and a greedy expansion strategy designed specifically for large-scale text corpora.

## Algorithm Novelty: BloomSpan vs BIDE+

The `BloomSpan` is a high-performance sequential phrase discovery algorithm designed to handle datasets that exceed available RAM. It introduces several key innovations:

### 1. Probabilistic Frequency Estimation (Bloom Pass)
Unlike traditional miners that store all n-gram candidates, this algorithm performs a **pre-emptive frequency estimation**:
* **Bloom Filter with Counters**: It uses a thread-safe Bloom Filter to estimate n-gram frequencies in a single pass.
* **Noise Reduction**: N-grams with a frequency lower than the `min_docs` threshold are discarded immediately, preventing memory explosion from rare sequences.

### 2. Greedy Expansion with Path Compression
The core mining logic employs a "Seed-and-Expand" strategy with significant optimizations:
* **Jumps**: Starting from an n-gram seed, the algorithm greedily expands to the right by selecting the most frequent subsequent tokens.
* **Global Pruning**: A bit-matrix (or vector of booleans) tracks already processed positions in the corpus. Once a long phrase is found, its constituent tokens are marked, preventing the redundant discovery of sub-phrases.

### 3. Hybrid Memory-Efficient Storage (optional)
The algorithm utilizes a custom `RawSeedEntry` structure to optimize memory footprint:
* **Fixed vs. Dynamic**: It uses a fixed-size array for short n-grams (up to 16 tokens) to avoid frequent heap allocations.
* **Switching Logic**: It transparently switches to dynamic vector storage only when the sequence length exceeds the threshold.

The miner is built for "Big Data" scenarios through a robust disk-based architecture:
* **External Merge Sort**: When RAM usage reaches a defined limit, the algorithm flushes sorted "chunks" of candidates to disk.
* **Priority Queue Merging**: It reconstructs the final candidate list using a disk-aware merge sort, allowing it to process corpora of virtually any size.

### 4. Multi-threaded Score Prioritization
Before expansion, candidates are prioritized based on a scoring function: $Score = Support \times Length$. This ensures that the most "descriptive" and heavy-weight phrases are processed first, maximizing the efficiency of the pruning bit-matrix.

## Configuration and CLI Flags

### C++ Core Engine Parameters

the first parameter is a directory or a CSV file. In case of a directory, all files are read, recursively. In case of CSV file, all rows are considered to be "documents".

Optional parameters:

* `--n`: **Minimum Support Threshold.** The minimum number of *unique documents* required for a phrase to be considered frequent. This is not a percentage, it is an absolute value of the number of documents.
* `--ngrams`: **Minimum Phrase Length.** Filters out trivial short sequences (e.g., set to 5+ for boilerplate).
* `--algo`: Algorithm selection (`bloom` (default), `bide`).
* `--threads`: To limit the number of OpenMP threads (defaults to hardware maximum; used only by the default algorithm, bloomspan).
* `--mem`: To limit the memory use by a ngram builder (used only by the default algorithm, bloomspan).

## Synthetic Data & Evaluation

To support scientific validation of precision and recall, the repository includes specialized utility scripts:

### Dataset Generator

Use `generate_test_dataset.py` to create a synthetic corpus with embedded "golden" patterns. This allows researchers to verify if the algorithms can recover known fragments at specific frequency and length thresholds.
```bash
python3 generate_test_dataset.py
```

It creates 100,000 documents in the ..`/test/generated` folder. Each document has 500 unique, synthetic words (which makes a dictionary of 50M unique words). It also injects the phrases into random documents according to the injection rules listed in the `generate_test_dataset.csv`:

```csv
"This is the first test sentence",3
"Another unique phrase for testing",5
"A third sentence",4
```

It is expected that running `./corpus_miner ../tests/generated --ngrams 3 --n 3` should create a file `results_max.csv` of the following structure:

```csv
phrase,freq,length,example_files
"another unique phrase for testing",5,5,"../tests/generated/test_file_74385.txt|../tests/generated/test_file_82694.txt"
"a third sentence",4,3,"../tests/generated/test_file_10549.txt|../tests/generated/test_file_36741.txt"
"this is the first test sentence",3,6,"../tests/generated/test_file_67301.txt|../tests/generated/test_file_91313.txt"
```
